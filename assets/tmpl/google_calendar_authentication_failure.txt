Hello {{service_provider_name}},
<br>This is to let you know that an error has occurred when trying to sync your appointment to Google Calendar. 
To view the error, please go to the Settings -> Error Log page. 
<br>
<br>Google will invalidate your authentication token from time to time so this is the most likely cause.
In order to resolve, please go to the Settings -> Connect page. If you do not see the "Authorize" button, click update on the Google profile once. 
<br>
This will enable the Authorize button. Use it to authenticate again.
<br><br>The {{site_name}} team
